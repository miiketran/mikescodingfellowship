# Mike's Coding Fellowship
*A mostly reasonable approach to Frontend Coding based on my experience and [clean-code-javascript](https://github.com/ryanmcdermott/clean-code-javascript), [Airbnb Style Guide](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript)*.

Welcome! If you're looking to produce code that is **readable, concise, performant, error/bug-prone, and evolveable** (AKA refactorable/scalable), you've come to the right place.

## What's The Purpose?

To level up the community of junior developers & coding bootcamp grads on the Frontend.

## What's Covered
JavaScript, React, CSS, Sass, TailwindCSS, form management ([React Hook Form](https://react-hook-form.com/) or [Formik](https://formik.org/) with [Yup](https://github.com/jquense/yup)) and the famous [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/).

## How will I grow?
The format includes:
1. Coding Tips: Practical tips to be more efficient
2. Coding Katas: Practical code reviews where you spot where rules have been broken
>The term 'Kata' means a structured way of doing things or practice. It has its roots in Japanese martial arts where learners spend much of their time practicing drills to improve specific moves. By repeating a movement on a consistent basis, the correct technique is gradually mastered.

Also, when I mention rules have been broken, please keep in mind that not all rules/feedback are equal. We'll be following a system the Netlify team created. See [here](https://www.netlify.com/blog/2020/03/05/feedback-ladders-how-we-encode-code-reviews-at-netlify/).
## TL;DR Feedback Ladder
1. Mountain/Blocking requires immediate action 🏔️
>Example: A developer is working on an issue and discovers more about the problem domain that was not previously known, realizing that the issue itself needs to be taken back to the drawing board because it is not feasible, needs to be broken up, or the solution doesn’t actually address the intended user stories.

2. Bounder/Blocking 🪨
>Example: A feature has been implemented and tagged for review. When testing the Deploy Preview, a reviewer notices that the wrong API endpoint is being used and the data displayed in the frontend is incorrect.

3. Pebble/Non-blocking but requires future action 🥌
>Example: During a Design review, a designer says they would like to change the background color of a status badge to help make the status more clear.

4. Sand/Non-blocking but requires future consideration ⏳
>Example: During code review, a team member leaves feedback about refactoring for readability. A very common example of [sand] feedback on the frontend team is code style or approach (not user-facing).
-  [Me: For Sand, I typically wouldn't approve the Pull Request (PR) initially until another code commit or conversation exchange.]

5. Dust/Non-blocking, “Take it or leave it” 🧹
>Example: During code review, a team member suggests a different name for a new variable.
- [Me: Dust is pretty whatever and I would typically approve without thinking twice, but hope they took the feedback.]

## Disclaimer
The following "Golden Rules" below are based on standards that are currently prevalent. These rules are made to help you digest and think about your code, but not meant to be absolutes. The criteria for listing the rules is that I have given the feedback often, or received it myself. I'm more than happy to have conversations to revise and add to this list if you've seen common mispractices that should be addressed.
